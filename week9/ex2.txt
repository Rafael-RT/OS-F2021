In order to decrease the Hit/Miss ratio we need to increase the number of pages.

In order to increase the ratio we need to decrease this number of pages. If the number of pages accessed for the last time=t is small then all this pages can fit into memory resulting in Hit/Miss ratio = inf (Misses = 0) We can also increase the number of page frames. Then more pages will be stored in RAM so the number of hits will increase => the ratio will increase.
